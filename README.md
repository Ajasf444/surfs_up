## Overview
The objective of this analysis is to determine if the weather in Oahu permits an ice cream and surf shop to be opened.
## Results

![june temperature summary statistics](/Results/june_summary_statistics.png)
![december temperature summary statistics](/Results/december_summary_statistics.png)

- It can be seen that the mean temperatures are in the mid to low 70s for June a summer month, and December a winter month.
- In the winter month of December at least 75% of the time the temperature was at least 69 degrees, historically.
- The relatively tight standard deviation for these two data sets means that 95% of the time one can expect the daily temperature to be within 8 degrees of the mean.

## Summary
Given the analysis done it can be reasonably concluded that the temperatures are high enough to warrant a surfing and ice cream shop in Oahu.
My suggestions would be to analyze the precipitation in Oahu to see if the rain/snow would reduce the appeal of an ice cream and surf shop.
Another suggestion would be to try and localize the analysis to the location specifically selected for the shop and look at the temperatures and precipitation/snow at that location.
